## A Chrome extension to open a chess.com game in lichess.org's analysis. ##

 This extension has the following features:

* Uploads any finished game on chess.com for lichess analysis. 
* Supports chess.com v3 (new chess.com) and v2 (old chess.com).
* Works from the game archive as well as from finished live games.
* Automatically toggles the new 'computer analysis' check box on the lichess.org import page.

Thanks to Allan Rempel who created a similar plugin for chess.com v2.
